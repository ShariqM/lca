- Color patches based on MSE, should see more error around movements

- Duck training, threshold adapting lambda = 0.01
- Reconstruct phase lambda = 0.05 use fixed lambda
- Result: As num iterations goes from 120 to 20...
    - SNR pretty fixed (16dB to 15dB)
    - Sparsity pretty bad for both up to 22.25%
    - Change coeff stay under 5

- Active coeff explosion problem
    - If lambda is too low explosion of coeff (fixed lambda)
    - If I start lambda at 0.1 * max(blah...) and have adaptive it works ok

- Soft threshold?
- Filter in time?
- Connection to time constant

* 1 - M=0.01, B=0.1 interesting Phi
* 2 - experiments eh
* 3 - no norm M, B=0.1
* 4 - try B=1? Failed even with 0.3
